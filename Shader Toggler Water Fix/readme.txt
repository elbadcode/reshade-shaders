since game version 4.6 the gamebanana gimi based fix for underwater blur only partially works. you will need a working reshade setup (provided elsewhere on my profile) with the included addon file in the appropriate addons folder (same as reshade install folder if you havent specified otherwise). The ini file needs to go to your game directory. This is because the addon is a bit old and precedes he current reshade addon api so it just grabs the current executable path. I need to update the addon and recompile to fix it so for now this is fine


Mhy driver only detects certain files in the game folder, e.g. reshade dxgi wrapper (though specialk dxgi.dll is fine) so it shouldn't remove the ini but to be safe and to keep reshade files organized you should symlink it from your reshade folder. I've included a batch file that can handle this automatically. Make sure you extracted this archive directly into your reshade install path or copied the files there and run the script. I recommend getting "link shell context menu" to make this easier but for any of my software that benefits from symlinking I will provide automation.
